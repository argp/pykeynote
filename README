Python extension module for the KeyNote trust management system

This is a Python extension module for KeyNote.  It provides a
high-level object-oriented interface to the KeyNote trust management
API.  From the KeyNote web page:

  Trust management is a unified approach to specifying and
  interpreting security policies, credentials, and relationships; it
  allows direct authorization of security-critical actions.  KeyNote
  credentials describe a specific delegation of trust and subsume the
  role of public key certificates; unlike traditional certificates,
  which bind keys to names, credentials can bind keys directly to the
  authorization to perform specific tasks.

For more information, see RFC 2704, keynote(1), keynote(3), keynote(4)
and keynote(5).

Although pykeynote has been developed on Linux and minimally tested on
OpenBSD, it will probably work on all Unix-like systems that satisfy
the following requirements:

Python 2.3 or higher.

Pyrex (optional) version 0.9.4 or above available from:
